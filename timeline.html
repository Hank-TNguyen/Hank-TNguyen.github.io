                <li>I wasn't the brightest kid in class, in fact I was below average both academically and physically. This, I blame the fact that I was born late December and started school when I was barely 6 yo.</li>

                <li>I won a district gold medal ðŸ¥‡ in table tennis, the first and also the most meaningful of many more in the years to come. </li>
                <li>I ended primary school. The teacher told my parents I was math inclined. I made solid progress... at least in math; but I was still slightly below average for social sciences.</li>

                <li>I was struggling with litertature, but exceled in science courses, esp. Physics.</li>
                <li>Before junior high school ended, I represented my school to compete in Physics Olympic, and awarded with a silver (district level) and consolidation prize (city level). Also, more table tennis medals ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥ˆðŸ¥‰!</li>

                <li>My high school went by quickly in 3 years (grade 10, 11 and 12).</li>
                <li>I am appreciative for what has happened. Life lessons learnt; I obtained a solid academic foundation which is the essential base for more advanced education.</li>

              <h4>January</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>I started a new chapter in my life! My family decided Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ was the destination for furthering my education. (The tuition is crazily expensive and yes, my parents have been covering all of my expenses at the cost of the major part of their life-time saving. I am proud to say that their 'investment' is about to payout!) </li>
